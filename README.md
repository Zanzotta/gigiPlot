# gigiPlot: Simplifying Plotting with ggplot2

**gigiPlot** is designed to make plotting interactions smoother, combining the simplicity of **R’s base graphics** with the power of **ggplot2**.

While **ggplot2** is celebrated for its layered grammar of graphics, **gigiPlot** brings the ease of R’s basic plotting functions to the ggplot2 framework. This means you can create plots quickly and intuitively, while still benefiting from ggplot2’s flexibility.

**Key Features:**
- **Simplicity:** Generate plots with straightforward commands, similar to R’s base graphics.
- **Customization:** Every ggplot object created with **gigiPlot** remains fully customizable. You’re never locked into default settings—adjust and refine your plots as needed.

**gigiPlot** is all about making plotting easier, without sacrificing the power and flexibility of ggplot2.
