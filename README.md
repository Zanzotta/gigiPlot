# gigiPlot 
The gigiPlot function was created to make plotting interactions smoother, similar to R’s basic graphics functions.
While it’s true that ggplot was built to follow the layered grammar of graphics approach, I believe basic graphics functions, like those in R, could look better when implemented on a ggplot foundation. 
Reminder, every ggplot object remains fully customizable even after plotting with the default options, so we are not imposing any constraints on customization.
